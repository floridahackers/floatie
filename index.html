      <h2 class="section-header">Cool, but I have a couple questions (FAQs)</h2>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
          <div class="faq mb-md">
            <h3 class="question">Who is Floatie for?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Any student that is involved or wants to contribute to tech organizations. Whether you are the president of the organization or you want to join, a community builder is anyone who is passionate about bringing like minded people together. Over the weekend, we will be bringing together all types of speakers to share their experiences in community building.</p>

            <h3 class="question">Food?</h3>
            <p class="answer">We have you covered from when you arrive Saturday morning to when you woefully depart on Sunday afternoon. If you have any dietary restrictions, be sure to let us know in your ticket registration.</p>

            <h3 class="question">What about travel to the conference?</h3>
            <p class="answer">We encourage carpooling. If your car has two or more total attendees you will be eligible to receive gas reimbursement. More details will be sent out closer to the event but be sure to save your receipts! </p>

            <h3 class="question">What kind of talks will there be during the event?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Over the weekend you will get to hear a variety of ideas and experiences through everything from keynotes to intimate discussion sessions. Check back closer to the event for a detailed schedule.</p>

            <h3 class="question">When should I arrive and depart from Orlando?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Check-in for the conference begins at 10 AM on Saturday the 1st and Opening Ceremonies will start at Noon. You can expect to leave around 3 PM on Sunday the 2nd.</p>

          <div class="faq mb-md">
            <h3 class="question">So Floatie is organized by Florida Hackers. Is it all about hackathons?</h3>
            <p class="answer">No way. We mean it when we say ALL university tech enthusiasts. Every club, event, organization, or effort to bring people together.</p>

            <h3 class="question">Where will I be staying for the weekend?</h3>
            <p class="answer">We combed through the great landscape of Orlando’s Airbnb and found the swankiest of houses for you to spend your weekend at. Each house will be filled with attendees, so go ahead, sit around the table for breakfast, watch some TV, and enjoy that Florida sun.</p>

            <h3 class="question">How much does Floatie cost?</h3>
            <p class="answer">The $35 student ticket includes housing for Saturday night as well as food throughout the weekend!</br>
                              If you are unable to cover your costs, we have a limited amount of GitHub Scholarships available. To apply, send us an email at hello@floridahackers.com.</p>

            <h3 class="question">What if I want to lead a discussion or speak?</h3>
            <p class="answer">That’s incredible! No problem, this is the place to do it! Apply to become a speaker by filling out an application. We will update everyone by September 12th and will reach out to set up some pre-event calls to go over your talk.</p>

            <h3 class="question">Darn I can’t go? Can I get a refund?</h3>
            <p class="answer">Of course! Up until September 19th, after that date unfortunately we have made our purchases. However, you can transfer your ticket to someone else if you let us know. </p>
